# Finance Management Database
> This project allows a user to manage a database of
> financial statement information for public companies.

## Motivation
> First an foremost, I created this project as a way for me to learn
> how to create and manage a project using Git and GitHub. Secondly, I
> wanted to learn web scraping, GUI development, and database management
> so this program was an excellent way to do those things.

## Build Status
>This project is currently a work-in-progress. I'm adding to it as often as I
>can until I have full desired functionality. Still needing to be added at this
>point is the ability to view entries in the database after adding the tables.
>Past that, I'm planning on adding functionality to export to Excel and other
>file formats as well as graphing capabilities.
